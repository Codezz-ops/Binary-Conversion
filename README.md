# Binary Conversion

This project marks a revision of my initial TypeScript project, [Binary-Conversion](https://github.com/Codex-ops/Binary-Conversion). The purpose of this endeavor is to refactor the project, providing an opportunity to assess my growth and progression as a developer.

## Why the Refactor?
By revisiting this seemingly straightforward project, I aim to measure the strides made in my coding skills and explore more efficient and elegant solutions.
